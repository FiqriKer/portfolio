### Work Experience

#### PHN Industry Sdn Bhd                                         Shah Alam, Selangor 
Process Engineer                                                  September 2020 â€“ September 2023

- Led the development of a new assembly line for future automotive car production in the company, resulting in a streamlined and efficient manufacturing process that significantly increased production output by 10% of the current production. 
- Effectively managed interfaces with 5 contractors and ensured timely review of all documents, enabling seamless collaboration and preventing potential delays. As a result, the project was completed on schedule, avoiding any costly setbacks and saving the company an estimated RM 200,000 in potential delay penalties. 
- Successfully modified jigs to accommodate new additional processes on existing parts, contributing to a 20% reduction in production time for those parts. This efficiency gain translated into faster delivery times and improved customer satisfaction. 
- Conducted process studies for 5 new parts and calculated capacity for the current assembly line, resulting in a 20% increase in productivity. This optimization allowed the company to meet a 30% rise in customer demand and maintain a competitive edge in the market. 
- Improved assembly jigs to deliver high-quality parts and data to customers, resulting in a significant reduction in defects and customer complaints by 40%. The enhanced quality reputation led to increased customer trust and repeat business. 

### Project

#### DATA SCIENCE ATTRITION PROJECT

[Publicationl(https://www.kaggle.com/code/ehfrus/attrition) 

- Built an employee attrition prediction model in Python. Utilized libraries like pandas for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation. Employed matplotlib for data visualization to understand variable relationships.
- Performed a thorough data analysis using pandas. Meticulously checked for missing values and rows in the dataset. Identified key influencers of the attrition rate through analysis. Designed the input features and output variable based on these findings.
- Developed a logistic regression model in Python using scikit-learn to predict attrition. This method yielded insights into employee characteristics influencing attrition for accurate forecasting.

#### DATA SCIENCE APPLE QUALITY PROJECT

[Publicationl(https://www.kaggle.com/code/ehfrus/apple-prediction-using-different-classification) 

- Utilized pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization in preparation for model training. Employed scikit-learn to implement various classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Evaluated the performance of each classification model and selected the most reliable and accurate one for apple quality prediction. This approach ensures high confidence in the model's ability to effectively assess apple quality.
- Applied machine learning techniques to real-world agricultural applications is demonstrated through the development of a model with the potential to streamline apple quality control processes and improve industry efficiency.

#### SQL BANK LOAN PROJECT

[Publicationl(https://perfect-pan-c37.notion.site/SQL-Bank-Loan-803183c4e02247f7a7d69a42deadc2e9) 
- Calculated overall loan applications, funded amounts, received payments, and approval rates. Delves deeper into loan status (good vs bad), monthly trends, and loan characteristics such as purpose and term.
- Employed GROUP BY to categorize loans by various attributes and analyse their performance. Used WHERE clauses to filter data for specific timeframes or loan grades, enabling focused analysis.
- Assessed the overall loan performance, identify trends, and understand loan characteristics associated with success. Empowered data-decisions for loan approval, risk management and product development.
