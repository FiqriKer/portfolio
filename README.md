- Built an employee attrition prediction model in Python. Utilized libraries like pandas for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation. Employed matplotlib for data visualization to understand variable relationships.
- Performed thorough data analysis using pandas. Checked for missing values and rows in the dataset. Identified key influencers of the attrition rate through analysis.
- Developed a logistic regression model in Python using scikit-learn to predict attrition, yielding insights into employee characteristics influencing attrition.

### Data Science Apple Quality Project
[Publication](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ehfrus/apple-prediction-using-different-classification)

- Utilized pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization in preparation for model training. Employed scikit-learn to implement various classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- Evaluated the performance of each classification model and selected the most reliable and accurate one for apple quality prediction.
- Demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to real-world agricultural applications, improving apple quality control processes and industry efficiency.

### SQL Bank Loan Project
[Publication](https://perfect-pan-c37.notion.site/SQL-Bank-Loan-803183c4e02247f7a7d69a42deadc2e9)

- Calculated overall loan applications, funded amounts, received payments, and approval rates. Analyzed loan status (good vs. bad), monthly trends, and loan characteristics such as purpose and term.
- Employed GROUP BY to categorize loans by various attributes and analyze their performance. Used WHERE clauses to filter data for specific timeframes or loan grades.
- Assessed overall loan performance, identified trends, and understood loan characteristics associated with success, empowering data-driven decisions for loan approval, risk management, and product development.
